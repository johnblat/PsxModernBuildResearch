if your goal of simulating cd-rom access is to exercise the codepath, then yes, you'd need to re-create an iso every time, but then in general, streaming data through the hardware sio is an operation generally known as "pcdrv", which Redux supports natively
typically, if you go down this route, the workflow is to have some way of switching between the codepaths of either going through the cd-rom, or through pcdrv
Redux when run with the vscode extension will map local project files to pcdrv, or you can use the command line to achieve the same
and on real hardware, when using unirom + nops in debug mode, the same will happen: nops will map local files to pcdrv
