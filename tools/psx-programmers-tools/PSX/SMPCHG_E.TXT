Known Bugs and Cautions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
< Known Bugs >

- data\hmd\scei\envmap\star09
- data\hmd\scei\envmap\venus26
	These 2D environment mapping data of HMD environment mapping (beta 
	version) can not be converted correctly HMD -> LAB -> HMD.
	This problem will be fixed in the future release.

- sample\sound\stream
	When channel starts/stops are repeatedly executed during SPU
        streaming execution, the SPU streaming might go into a loop.
        This problem will be fixed in the next release. 


Directory Structure Changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- sample\graphics\hmd\pdriver
	Deleted due to the disclosure of the source code for the HMD 
	primitive driver.

- sample\kanji\chinese\fontdata
- sample\kanji\chinese\viewer
	Chinese font data and Chinese font data viewer were added.

Existing Samples Improved, Changed and Corrected
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- sample\etc\card

	the Memory Card appeared as illegal characters.  This has been 
	fixed.
