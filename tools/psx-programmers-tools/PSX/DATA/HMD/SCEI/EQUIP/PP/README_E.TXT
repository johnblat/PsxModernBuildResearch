pp: Sample data with Camera primitive

<description>
	This data shows how to set Camera(view point) parameter of
	equipment primitives.
	A red paper plane and a blue one are going through six translucent
	rings.
	Please use anim/animview in HMD sample program directory to run.

	There are three data by the type of Camera.

	1. pp_world
		The camera is set on the WORLD coordinate, and projection
		is also set.

	2. pp_fix
		The camera is set on the coordinate of the red paper plane,
		and projection is also set.

	2. pp_aim
		The camera is set on the coordinate of the red paper plane in
		the direction to the blue one, and projection is also set.


	The following steps create this data:

	1. Based on the modeling data and the animation are created by 
	   Softimage 3D.
	2. "xhmd" is used to dis-assemble.
	3. Equipment primitive types are edited by text editor.
	4. In conclusion, HMD files "pp_*.hmd" are generated by HMD
	   assembler(labp).
