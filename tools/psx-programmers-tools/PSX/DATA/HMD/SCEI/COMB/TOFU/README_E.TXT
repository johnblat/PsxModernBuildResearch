tofu: a combined sample of animated MIMe

<description>
	This data shows how to control MIMe parameters with general-purpose
	animation primitives.
	Please use anim/animview in HMD sample program directory to run.

	The following steps create this data:

	1. Three variations of white objects are created as MIMe keys with
	   LightWave 3D.
	2. "Animation Saver for PlayStation" generated three HMD files.
	3. "mkmime" is used to generate an HMD file contains MIMe information.
	4. "xhmd" is used to dis-assemble.
	5. Animation primitives are added to the LAB file created in step 4.
	   These animation primitives control only MIMe parameters.
