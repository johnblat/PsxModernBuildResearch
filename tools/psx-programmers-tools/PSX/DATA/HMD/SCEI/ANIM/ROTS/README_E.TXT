rots: variation of six rotation orders

<description>
	  This data demonstrates variation of rotation order for
	HMD animation.  You will see six string objects like the following:

		XYZ	YXZ	ZXY

		XZY	YZX	ZYX

	These strings show order of rotation matrix.
	For example, "XYZ" object is rotating with matrices for rotation
	around X axis, Y axis and Z axis.  This means, the object is
	rotating around Z axis at first, and Y axis, finally X axis.

	Please use anim/animview to run.


	The following steps created this data:

	1. Based on the data is created by 3D Stdio MAX R2 and GAMUT-PSm.
	2. A LAB file "rots.lab" is generated by xhmd.
	3. Interpolation primitive types are edited by text editor.
	4. In conclusion, HMD file "rots.hmd" is generated by HMD assembler
	   (labp).
