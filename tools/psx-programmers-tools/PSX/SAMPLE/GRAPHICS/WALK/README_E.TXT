<Description>
	This programs demonstrate how to move an object, a boy or a normal line, walk 
 	along the surface generated by polygons. The surface can be any type, closed 
	surface or with boundaries, etc.  As for the surface with boundaries, special
	process such as wrap round is necessary. See below for this special process:

	(1) Divide space by polygons that generate a surface.
	(2) Obtain the polygon to which an object belongs.
	(3) Constrain an object to the closest surface.
	(4) Change the direction of an object in the same direction as the polygon normal
            line.
	(5) When an object moves beyond a polygon boundary, rotate an object along with
            the normal line.
	(1) is performed only once at the beginning of the program and others are 
          per frame.
