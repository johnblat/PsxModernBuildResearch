Known Bugs and Cautions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Disclosure of HMD Primitive Driver Source Codes> 
- The source codes for libhmd were disclosed in psx\src\lib\hmd.
Please refer to psx\src\lib\hmd\readme_e.txt for details.

<Limitations on libhmd>
- The environment map is provided as a Beta version, because the 
format may change in future releases without keeping compatibility.  
The Beta-version primitives are not officially supported by SCE at 
this point.  If you want to use them for creating titles, please do 
so on your own responsibility.

<Addition of libmcx>
- Libmcx, the library to control the PDA, was added.

<Addition of Memory Card GUI Module>
- McGUI, the module which supports the Memory Card access in the user 
interface level, was added.

<Addition of SN Debugger for Windows ver. 2.4>
- SN Debugger for Windows ver. 2.4 was added.  Due to this addition, 
the structure of the pssn directory was changed. Please refer to 
pssn\readme.1st(Japanese) for details.

<Deletion of libsn.a>
- Libsn.a was deleted, because it was judged unnecessary.

<Known Bugs>
- In the Extended Sound Library (libsnd), the phonation of noise 
currently does not work properly. Use the Basic Sound Library 
(libspu) to use noises. This problem will be fixed in the next 
release.

- When channel starts/stops are repeatedly executed during SPU streaming
execution, the SPU streaming might go into a loop. This problem will be 
fixed in the next release.

DMPSX
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Even though the macro conversion failed, it was judged as a normal
end. This problem has been fixed by processing the failure as an abnormal
end.


CD-ROM Library (libcd)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Library Specification Changes>
- Because the "pause" command issued at the data read completion with 
CdRead() was a block type, it took time to perform the process when the
data read was completed. Thus it has been changed to a non-block type.

- The processing speed of CdControl()-related functions, called 
immediately after CdReadSync(), was slightly improved.


Extended CD-ROM Library (libds)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Library Bug Fixes>
- In the retry process of DsRead(), although the operation of DsRead() 
was at a halt, the simple callback system started working. This problem 
has been fixed.  

<Library Specification Changes>
- To eliminate the waste in processing, the specification to issue the 
"pause" command has been changed to issue the "nop" command when the 
operation is already in the "pause" state. 


ETC Library (libetc)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Header File Modification>
- When macros were dicompressed by libetc.h macro, getScratchAddr(offset), 
because the argument "offset" was not enclosed with parentheses, 
decompression was not correctly performed depending on the argument.  
This problem has been fixed. 


HMD Library (libhmd)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Functions Added>
- The primitive drivers for tiled textures were added..

  Please refer to "Appendix A: Primitive type list" in format\hmd.doc 
  and overview\hmdstat.xls for details on the added drivers. Since this
  file includes some macros, a warning message might be displayed when
  opening it with the EXCEL. For reference, the use of the EXCEL viewer
  97 included on the Technical Reference CD is recommended to avoid macro
  virus infection by unexpected causes although this file on the CD-ROM
  does NOT included any dangerous macros. To open the file with the
  EXCEL, please take an appropriate measure such as virus check to make
  sure that it is secure in advance.

 
Basic Graphics Library (libgpu)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Functions Added>
- The function to obtain the current drawing environment, GetDrawEnv2(),
was added.

<Library Bug Fixes>
- With ContinueDraw(), the last packet of the OT was not occasionally 
executed. This problem has been fixed.

- When ContinueDraw() was executed again before the process for the 
OT inserted by ContinueDraw() was completed, the operation was not 
perfomed correctly. This problem has been fixed.
Due to this, the primitive which returns the TPAGE to the previous 
state has been removed. To change the TPAGE, it is necessary to add 
DR_TPAGE primitive or the like to the last packet of the OT inserted by
ContinueDraw().  

<Header File Modification>
- The functions GetTPage() and GetClut(), which are used in setTPage 
and setClut in libgpu.h, have been changed to their macro version, 
getTPage and getClut.

- When macros were dicompressed by libgpu.h macro getClut(x,y), because 
the arguments "x, y" were not enclosed with parentheses, decompression 
was not correctly performed depending on the arguments. This problem 
has been fixed. 


Math Library (libmath)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Library Bug Fixes>
- When converting negative numbers (a string of numerical values with a 
minus sign) with atof() and strtod(), the result was 0. This problem has 
been fixed.

It said that the following problems were fixed in Release 4.3, but 
they were not actually.  They have been fixed in this release.

- When converting (int)0x80000000 to a floating or double type, an 
infinite loop was entered. This problem has been fixed.

- When converting (floating or double)-0.0 to an int, 0x80000000 was 
returned. This problem has been fixed.


Extended Memory Card Library (libmcrd)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Library Bug Fixes>
- When the Memory Card was accessed, insertion or removal of the 
controller or another Memory Card to the other slot resulted in access 
failure occasionally.  This problem has been fixed by adding a retry 
logic. 
 
- With MemCardOpen(), even if the Memory Card was removed just before 
the open operation, the file was opened properly. This problem has been 
fixed.

- When the Memory Card was removed while being initialized by 
MemCardFormat(), it was judged as a defective card (halfway-initialized.) 
This problem has been fixed.  

<Function Specification Change>
- MemCardInit() has been separated as an object file.

Controller Library (libpad)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Library Bug Fixes>
- When the Multi Tap was used, if the Multi Tap itself or the controller 
inserted into the other port was repeatedly inserted or removed, 
an incorrect value was set to the receive buffer for the Multi Tap 
occasionally. This problem has been fixed.    

- When the Analog Controller (SCPH-1180) was connected, even though the 
terminal type was switched by pressing the analog mode switch, the 
returned value was set to 2 and kept unchanged. This problem has been 
fixed.

- When initialization was performed by PadInitMtap(), if the mouse was 
inserted into the controller port 2, it was not recognized. This problem 
has been fixed.

- When turning on/off the actuator of the controller at the frequency of 
every frame, the vibration was stopped completely. This problem has been 
fixed.


Extended Sound Library (libsnd)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Library Bug Fixes>
- When the SEQ/SEP data was played, if automatic changes of panning to 
sound effects with SsUtAutoPan() were executed, proper changes were not 
made. This problem has been fixed.

- When the SEQ data was played with the sound whose shift value of VAB 
was set to 128 or higher, the sound was not phonated at a correct pitch. 
This problem has been fixed.

- With the VB data transfer by SsVabTransBodyPartly(), if SsVabClose() was 
executed before transferring all the VB, SsVabClose() failed in operation 
and then SsVabTransBodyPartly() was not performed correctly.  
This problem has been fixed. 

- The SEQ/SEP data was opened only up to 31 by SsSeqOpen(), SsSeqOpenJ(), 
SsSepOpen() and SsSepOpenJ(). This problem has been fixed.

- When executing SsInit(), SpuReadDecodedData() did not return a correct 
return value. This problem has been fixed.

- Data transfer to the sound buffer is performed in units of 64 bytes, 
so if the VB data size was not a multiple of 64, the memory areas which 
followed the area allocated by the data transfer were damaged.  
This problem has been fixed so that the allocated memory size should be 
multiple of 64 bytes. 


Basic Sound Library (libspu)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Function Added>
- SpuLSetVoiceAttr(), a function which combines and sets the voice 
attributs of different types, was added. 

<Library Bug Fixes>
- With SpuMallocWithStartAddr(), although there was enough free space in 
the sound memory, the memory could not be allocated from the specified 
top address. This problem has been fixed.
