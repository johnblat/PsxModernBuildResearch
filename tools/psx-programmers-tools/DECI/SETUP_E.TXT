 * Introduction
   The PlayStation DECI driver is a Windows (95/NT) driver that enables the
PlayStation development board to be used with various tools. Please install the
driver according to the instructions below when using CodeWarrior R4 or later,
or other tools that require the DECI driver.

   Note that SDevTC, which works with dexbios, h25bios, etc., cannot be used in
conjunction with the DECI driver.


 * Operating system and machine
   Support is provided for the four combinations given below. Select the 
appropriate one for your operating system and machine.

  A. Windows95 and the DTL-H2000/DTL-H2700
  B. Windows95 and the DTL-H2500
  C. WindowsNT and the DTL-H2000/DTL-H2700
  D. WindowsNT and the DTL-H2500

     Connect the DTL-H2000/H2700 to the PC by following the instructions for
the development board or those in the start-up manual.

   A-2. Initializing the board (DTL-H2700 only)

     Please update the DTL-H2700 to the latest firmware release. The update can
be performed by executing the following commands from the DOS prompt or DOS.
This operation is not necessary for the DTL-H2000.
       > cd deci\flash27

driver. Select Start Menu -> Settings -> Control Panel -> System -> Device
Manager -> PlayStation -> DTL-H2000 delete.

     In the SDevTC environment, if loading of dexbios takes place in
config.sys, remove or comment out the line.

     Copy deci\psx95isa to an appropriate location on the hard disk.
     Double click the deci\psx95isa\psx95isa.inf in the copied files.

     Find the line beginning with ;IRQConfig=

     If an IRQ is to be used, first delete the initial ; then enter the board
setting such as 10, 12, 15 (e.g., IRQConfig=10).
     If an IRQ is not used, leave the ; as is.

     A line beginning with IOConfig= should appear next. Specify the I/O
address in this line, as in IOConfig=1240-124b(3ff::)

     The initial values are set to IRQ: none, I/O address: 1340.
