# Serial Cable

The [PlayStation Link Cable (SCPPH-1040)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Link_Cable) was intended to allow two consoles to be connected in order to play compatible multiplayer games on separate consoles. For instance, games in the Wipeout series.

The cable is a standard 9-pin serial cable with a proprietary connector on each end. However, if one cuts the cable in half, and connects the correct wires to a device that can send serial data, one can send data to the PSX.
